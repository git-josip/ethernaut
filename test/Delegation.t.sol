        //
        // Delegate call works like this: the code at the target address is executed in the context (i.e. at the address) of the calling
        // contract and msg.sender and msg.value do not change their values. This means that a contract can dynamically load code from a
        // different address at runtime. Storage, current address and balance still refer to the calling contract, only the code is taken from the called address.

        // Delegation contract expose a fallback function. A fallaback function is a function that get called when:
        // 1) you send money to a contract that is not implementing the `receive` function
        // 2) you are calling a function that does not exist on the contract
        // In the fallabck function of Delegation it make a `delegatecall` on the `Delegate` contract passing the whole `msg.data`
        // When you execute a delegatecall from contract A to contract B you are executing the `B` function but with the `A` context (storage, msg.sender, and so on)
        // This means that when we execute the `pwn` function on `Delegate` it will modify the storage of the `Delegation` contract!
        // Because of this we are able to become the new `owner` of the Delegation` contract.
